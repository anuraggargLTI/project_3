Reviews: * Every Ferrari is the result of an uncompromising design approach that masterfully integrates styling and aerodynamic requirements. The design of the 458 Italia features compact and aerodynamic lines which confirm the performance oriented nature of Ferrari. The modular chassis is an all-new design featuring new alloys to keep the weight down. The chassis rests on painted alloy wheels with Pirelli P-Zero performance tires. The interior has a host of features which complement the Italia. Front Leather-trimmed bucket seats complement the wondrous leather door trim. The styling of the steering wheel underscores a sense of continuity with classic Ferrari styling cues, whilst representing innovation by eliminating the indicator and windscreen wiper stalks and clustering all of the controls on the steering wheel. An AM/FM stereo with 6-disc changer, auxiliary audio input, iPod integration and Bluetooth comes with 6 speakers and speed-sensitive volume control. Performance requires a performer and the 4.5L V8 engine does not disappoint. 562hp @ 9000rpm guarantees that you have the power you need, allowing for a 0-60 sprint of 3.4 seconds. One of the 458 Italiaâs most significant technological innovations is its dual-clutch gearbox which contemporaneously boosts performance and ride comfort. The result is a progressive increase in response, more torque distributed to the wheels at lower engine speeds, and a powerful seventh gear that takes the car up to its maximum speed.

ZFFGT61A350145123,Convertible,Norwood,188,2062,"The Ferrari 575 Superamerica was introduced in 2005 and provided all the freedom of a convertible coupled with the security of a coupe. The 575 Superamerica features a carbon-fiber frame integrated with electrochromic glass panel roof. This is extremely unique because it was the first roof of its kind to be fitted to a production vehicle. When closed, the opacity of the roof can be adjusted via a dial in the cabin, turning the glass from fully transparent like a conventional sunroof to only allowing in 1% of available light. With just the press of a button, the roof easily rotates back to rest flush with the rear lid, allowing the rear window to function as a wind deflector. A total of 559 Ferrari 575 Superamerica's were built, following Enzo Ferrari's philosophy that there should always be one fewer vehicles available than what the market demanded. The 575 Superamerica was a very special vehicle and destined to become a future collectible from the moment it was announced. Absolutely stunning Superamerica in classic colors with extensive records! This 575 Superamerica is equipped with Scuderia Shields, red brake calipers, rear wall upholstery in beige leather, leather bucket seats, yellow rev counter, a HiFi Stereo with a 6-disc CD change, and all stitching in color. This 2005 575M F1 Superamerica was traded by a local customer who initially sought-out one of the finest red/tan examples he could acquire. Finished in the classic Rosso Corsa over Beige color scheme, this example has a completely clean carfax, all accessories and full service records. The factory build sheet lists: Red Brake Calipers Scuderia Shields Rear Wall Upholstery in Beige Leather Yellow Rev Counter Beige Carpets HiFi w/6CD changer The 30k Timing Belts were done in May of 2008 by Ferrari of L.I. (the car having spent the majority of it's life in the NYC region) and the glass top was replaced at that time as well. The records show consistent oil changes thereafter until our client acquired the car in 2016. Upon taking delivery, he commissioned another timing belt service, completed here at our factory-authorized workshop in Dec of '16 with 3900 miles. Since then, the car has been enjoyed selectively and kept here in our climate-controlled storage facility. It's in absolute top-notch condition and we welcome prospective buyers to view it in person or send their agent to do the same.

Reviews: * The 2014 Ferrari F12Berlinetta not only ushers in a whole new generation of prancing horse 12-cylinders but is also the most powerful and high performance Ferrari of the range product. It boasts a maximum power output of 740hp at 8250 rpm, while its specific power output is 118 CV/l, a record for this kind of engine. Responsiveness and strong pick-up are assured by maximum torque of 690 Nm, 80% of which is already on tap at 2500 rpm. Exceptional strides have been made in regard to fuel consumption and emissions both of which have been slashed by 30% making the F12berlinetta a benchmark for its reference segment. Its wheelbase is shorter, the engine and driver seat have been lowered and the rear is more compact thanks to the new suspension and gearbox layout. The interior space has been optimized to provide a sporty driving experience as well as guarantee maximum comfort. A perfect harmony has been struck between advanced technologies and sophisticated, beautifully hand-crafted details both of which are intrinsic to Ferrari's DNA.[!@@Additional Info@@!]160 Point Safety Inspection,4-Wheel Disc Brakes,6 Speakers,ABS brakes,AM/FM radio,Adaptive suspension,Air Conditioning,Auto-dimming Rear-View mirror,Auto-dimming door mirrors,Automatic temperature control,Bumpers: body-color,Ceramic disc brakes,Delay-off headlights,Driver door bin,Dual front impact airbags,Dual front side impact airbags,Electronic Stability Control,Four wheel independent suspension,Front Bucket Seats,Front Center Armrest,Front anti-roll bar,Front dual zone A/C,Front reading lights,Fully automatic headlights,Garage door transmitter,Headlight cleaning,Heated door mirrors,High intensity discharge headlights: Bi-Xenon,Illuminated entry,Infotainment System w/Navigation & Bluetooth,Leather Seat Trim,Leather steering wheel,Low tire pressure warning,Navigation System,Outside temperature display,Overhead console,Passenger cancellable airbag,Passenger door bin,Passenger vanity mirror,Power door mirrors,Power driver seat,Power passenger seat,Power steering,Power windows,Radio data system,Rain sensing wipers,Rear anti-roll bar,Rear fog lights,Rear window defroster,Remote keyless entry,Security system,Speed control,Speed-sensing steering,Spoiler,Sport Bucket Seats,Sport steering wheel,Steering wheel mounted audio controls,Tachometer,Telescoping steering wheel,Tilt steering wheel,Traction control,Trip computer,Variably intermittent wipers,Voltmeter,Wheels: Front 20' x 9.5'/Rear 20' x 11.5' Alloy",V12,Nero Daytona Metallic,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,Ferrari,FALSE,740,Nero,FALSE,FALSE,42.1964,3/5/2020,UNKNOWN,267707015,-71.1851,Ferrari,2 seats,7019,F12 Berlinetta,5,"740 hp @ 8,250 RPM",226900,4.882352941,273675,Ferrari-Maserati of New England,FALSE,"690 lb-ft @ 6,000 RPM",M,Coupe,RWD,Rear-Wheel Drive,107.1 in,76.5 in,2014

ZFFYR51B000118781,Coupe,Hinsdale,292,60521,"The Ferrari 360 Modena road car replaced the popular Ferrari F355 in 1999.  Shortly thereafter, Ferrari began the development the of the 360 Challenge Race Car for the Ferrari Challenge client racing series.  The 360 Challenge was a fully developed factory race car for clients to race.  This car was significantly lighter and quicker than the street version.  Ferrari management decided to develop a full, professional race version to contest the FIA GT race series in the N-GT class (the N-GT class kept the cars very close to street trim).  As was the tradition since the 1970's at Ferrari, the Italian tuning firm Michelotto was contracted to develop the new 360 Challenge race car into a car for the FIA series.  The car was called the 360 N-GT.  The car was spectacular.  The engine was tuned to 430 HP (from 400 HP), the weight was reduced to below 2500 pounds (over 500 pounds lighter than the street car).  Michelotto widened the front of the cars by 2.5 inches and achieved weight reduction by using carbon fiber for the doors, front fenders and hood.  The resulting performance was fantastic, the car was introduced in 2000 and by the end of the 2001 racing season, the 360 N-GT had won the FIA driver's and team cups.  This was a wonderful result for Ferrari as Ferrari had not won any championships in production class racing since the 275 GTB corsa cars of the mid 1960's.  Michelotto built just 17 of these special Ferrari 360 N-GT cars. Each car began as a Ferrari Challenge racer and was then modified to N-GT specifications.  The rarity, performance and use-ability makes these cars a highlight among collectible Ferrari Race Cars. 2002 Ferrari 360 N-GT  Michelotto VIN: 016M We are proud to offer one of the best 360 N-GT's available anywhere.  We acquired the car for the current owner in 2012 and have maintained it ever since.  This car was never raced or damaged & it's mechanically & cosmetically outstanding.  A full documented history of the car is available, listing all events, owners, etc. A full service history since 2012 completed by Continental accompanies the car.  Spares include two full sets of wheels, the original Michelotto engine, the SD2 Diagnostic computer and many other spares.  Additionally, a copy of the Original Michelotto Build Sheet.  The car has been awarded the coveted FCA Platinum award multiple times since 2012.  In addition to the platinum awards, 016M has been carefully exercised at Continental and Ferrari Club of America events on a regular basis since 2012.  This is a rare opportunity to purchase a collectible, authentic and important Ferrari race car that can be driven, shown or simply collected.

This 328 stands the above others.  While it is NOT a sub 5,000 mile trailer queen with amazing cosmetics and questionable mechanical condition due to lack of use; it IS an outstanding original car that has been serviced and driven on a regular basis.    We just completed a full 5 year (30,000 mile) service including timing belts in June of 2020.  We completed the previous 5 year (30,000 mile) service in June of 2015 when the odometer read 20,204 miles. We have service records dating from 2004 when the car displayed 17,055 miles on the odometer.  The car appears to have all original paint on the body work.  With a paint meter, the thickness of the paint measures 5-9 mills on all body panels.  Only the front bumper has been refinished along with NOS stock front lenses and NOS front marker lamp assemblies replaced due to minor cosmetic wear.  The car has all of the factory original equipment.  All books, tools, targa top cover, keys, etc.  Nothing is missing, everything works.  It is a stunning example. No expense spared to keep the car in proper  order, completely sorted and ready for use. Two sets of wheels (NOS wheels and new tires installed in 2018) Original wheels come with the car.  This is the right car for a serious 328 enthusiast or a Ferrari collector that wants an original, correct 328 for his collection.   Awards and Events include:  1. Ferrari Classiche Certification 2.

16447,Coupe,Lake Bluff,335,60044,"Ferrari Lake Forest is proud to present this stunning 1973 Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona. The name ""Daytona"" came about as a result of Ferrari's sweeping 1-2-3 victory at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1967. It was initially introduced to the world at the Paris Auto Salon in 1968 and would go on to be produced over a full five-year production run that would eventually see only 1,284 examples being completed; making it even rarer than the Ferrari F40. The engine is rated at 352bhp which gives it a top speed of just shy of 175mph. The gearbox was a fully synchronized five-speed transaxle with a ""ZF"" limited slip differential. The transaxle was mounted in the rear for optimal weight distribution, and a four-wheel independent suspension featured wishbones and coil springs at all four corners. This particular Daytona was imported in 1973 by Chinetti. We have a much more extensive, individualized history on this fully-documented car that we are happy to supply. The original books and manuals remain with the vehicle and the tool and jack kits are also include with the purchase. This Ferrari has an incredible four-inch thick binder of the original records, invoices, and assembly details going back to the original order and each subsequent sale. It is by far the most comprehensively documented Ferrari Daytona we have ever encountered. This is a completely documented, all matching number, rust and accident free example. We have installed new Borani 8 & 9 sized wire wheels and tires, performed the maintenance, and this is a great driver that looks like new! This Daytona comes with the Massini letter to authenticate it as well. As an authorized Ferrari dealer since 1982 and a Classiche authorized center, we are able to perform all work and can Classiche-certify this car for the next owner.
